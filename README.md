# Dead-Cells-Autosplitter
This is a Dead Cells autosplitter for LiveSplit. 

For information on what an autosplitter is, go [here](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md). For information on ItB Speedruns, go [here](https://www.speedrun.com/deadcells).

This autosplitter supports the Steam version of Dead Cells, game versions 1.6 through 1.8. If you need an autosplitter for an earlier version, please check the "Old" folder included in this github repository. If you are speedrunning a non-Steam version of Dead Cells, _please_ get in touch with R30hedron on Discord (@R30hedron#9529).

The following are implemented:

* Automatic Timer Starts
* Automatic Splits
* Automatic Timer Resets
* Support for Steam versions 1.6 through 1.8

Please forward any feedback, questions, or concerns to R30hedron on Discord (@R30hedron#9529)

Special thanks to:
* Mintys for the initial autosplitter
* Blargel for previously maintaining the autosplitter.

Changelog: 
* 1.0 (Apr-2020) Although the autosplitter has been in use for a while, this is the first update posted to Github.
