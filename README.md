If you need an autosplitter for an earlier version, please check the "Old" folder included in this github repository or contact R30hedron on Discord with the version you need. If you wish to speedrun a non-Steam version of Dead Cells, _please_ get in touch with R30hedron on Discord (@R30hedron#9529) so that we can verify the autosplitter is functional for your version.

The following are implemented:

* Automatic Timer Starts
* Automatic Splits
    * Includes options to split on entering transition rooms, on leaving transition rooms, or both.
* Automatic Timer Resets
* Support for English and French localizations.

Please forward any feedback, questions, or concerns to R30hedron on Discord (@R30hedron#9529).

Special thanks to:
* Mintys for the initial autosplitter
* Blargel for previously maintaining the autosplitter.
* Midknight13 for requesting and verifying autosplitter addresses for the GOG version.
