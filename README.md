# Dead-Cells-Autosplitter
This is a Dead Cells autosplitter for LiveSplit. 

For information on what an autosplitter is, go [here](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md). For information on ItB Speedruns, go [here](https://www.speedrun.com/deadcells).

To download the autosplitter manually, go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R30hedron/Dead-Cells-Autosplitter/master/DEAD_CELLS.asl), right-click, and save as.

This autosplitter supports the Steam version of Dead Cells, game versions 1.6.2 and 1.8.5. If you need an autosplitter for an earlier version, please check the "Old" folder included in this github repository or contact R30hedron on Discord with the version you need. If you wish to speedrun a non-Steam version of Dead Cells, _please_ get in touch with R30hedron on Discord (@R30hedron#9529) so that we can verify the autosplitter is functional for your version.

The following are implemented:

* Automatic Timer Starts
* Automatic Splits
* Automatic Timer Resets
* Support for Steam versions 1.6.2 and 1.8.5
* Support for GOG Version 1.7.1
* Support for English and French localizations.

Please forward any feedback, questions, or concerns to R30hedron on Discord (@R30hedron#9529).

Special thanks to:
* Mintys for the initial autosplitter
* Blargel for previously maintaining the autosplitter.
* Midknight13 for requesting and verifying autosplitter addresses for the GOG version.

Changelog: 
* 1.1 (May-2020) Major rework of autosplitter; changed to be monolithic and much easier to update
